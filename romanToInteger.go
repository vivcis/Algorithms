//leetcode - 13. Roman to Integer
//Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
//Symbol       Value
//I             1
//V             5
//X             10
//L             50
//C             100
//D             500
//M             1000
//For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II.
//The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
